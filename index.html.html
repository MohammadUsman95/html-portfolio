            <p>A front-end dev takes care of layout, design and interactivity using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. They take an idea from the drawing board and turn it into reality. What you see and what you use, such as the visual aspect of the website, the drop down menus and the text, are all brought together by the front-end dev, who writes a series of programmes to bind and structure the elements, make them look good and add interactivity. These programmes are run through a browser.</p>

            <p>Web development skills are in high demand  worldwide and well paid too making development a great career option. It is one of the easiest accessible higher paid fields as you do not need a traditional university degree to become qualified.</p>
        
            <p>A web developer is a programmer responsible for turning user stories, mockups, and web designs into functional websites. They use web fundamentals such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build, manage, and deploy web applications. Web developers might also use a variety of programming languages depending on your website's technology stack, including Python, PHP, and Ruby. A web developer must also ensure that the website is compatible with all devices and browsers.</p>
